## 📖 About

Devify is an **enterprise-grade AI-powered conversation intelligence and data application platform**.

Its core value is straightforward:

1. Collect fragmented communication content from enterprise work scenarios
2. Understand both text and image content with AI
3. Transform raw conversations into structured summaries and reusable data
4. Feed that data into downstream systems such as JIRA, knowledge bases, and workflow automation

What matters most is not only collection or summarization, but the abstraction behind the system:

- **Data Layer**: unify scattered raw inputs
- **Data Processing Layer**: convert raw content into structured understanding
- **Data Application Layer**: build reusable business applications on top of that data

This layered design is the real long-term value of the project, because it makes horizontal expansion much easier as new sources and new applications are added.

## 💡 Why We Built It

Devify did not start from an abstract product idea. It grew out of real enterprise collaboration problems.

In many teams, important information is scattered across:

- WeChat groups
- email threads
- screenshots
- temporary chat messages
- cross-functional coordination channels
- personal notes and informal records

Decisions get made, requirements get clarified, and issues get solved, but the result often never becomes structured knowledge.

This creates recurring enterprise pain points:

- important context is scattered across multiple channels
- enterprise and personal information are separated and difficult to unify
- key decisions are easy to miss or lose
- manual knowledge consolidation is expensive and unreliable
- downstream systems receive incomplete information
- valuable business data remains trapped inside unstructured conversations

Devify exists to solve that gap.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧵 **Threadline workflow** — forward chat records and screenshots by email, get structured summaries delivered to JIRA
- 🖼️ **Multimodal understanding** — AI analysis of both text and images, including intent detection
- 🔌 **17+ LLM providers** — bind different models to different jobs through a unified management console
- 📬 **Built-in inbound email** — Haraka SMTP server with auto-assigned per-user addresses
- 🖥️ **Management console** — configure providers, models, notifications, and scheduled tasks from the UI
- 🐳 **One-command deployment** — full stack (API, worker, scheduler, UI, MySQL, Redis, Nginx, Haraka) via Docker Compose
- 🔓 **Open core** — Apache-2.0 licensed platform with a separately licensed billing module

## 🎯 Purpose and Scenarios

At the current stage, the clearest and most practical workflow is:

- collect chat records and related materials through email
- analyze both text and image content
- generate structured summaries
- output reusable data for project delivery and business workflows

The core purpose is to bring fragmented enterprise and personal information into one unified system, so it can be continuously organized, understood, and reused.

Today, email is the first stable entry point.

In the future, Devify can expand to unify more inputs such as:

- voice content
- meeting notes and transcripts
- forwarded records from more platforms
- other multimodal work artifacts

## 🧩 How Devify Works

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/how-devify-works.svg" alt="How Devify Works: information sources flow through LLM processing into data applications" width="100%">
</div>

One pipeline: fragmented information flows in, LLMs turn it into structured data, and that data powers a growing set of applications — TODO management and the delivery hub today, with the data application layer designed to keep absorbing new apps.

## 🧵 Threadline Core Feature

Threadline is the current flagship workflow inside Devify.

It was born from a practical enterprise pain point: many issues are discussed and even resolved inside chat tools, but the resulting knowledge never enters the formal delivery system.

Threadline focuses on:

- collecting conversation content
- understanding images and text with AI
- generating structured summaries
- delivering the result to downstream systems such as JIRA

This approach is not limited to WeChat chat records. It can be extended to many communication scenarios while keeping the output structured and reusable.

More importantly, Threadline is not just a single feature. It is an example of how the platform turns fragmented communication into reusable data products through the three-layer model.

## 🖥️ Management Console

Runtime configuration is no longer limited to Django Admin.

Many core settings can now be configured in the management UI:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/management/llm/config` | Provider credentials, models, defaults, and connection testing |
| `/management/app-settings` | Global app settings, Threadline model bindings, notification channels, Relay smart-channel model bindings |
| `/management/threadline/config` | Threadline workflow model settings |
| `/management/threadline/periodic-tasks` | Scheduled tasks |
| `/management/notifier/channels` | Webhook and notification channels |
| `/management/notifier/settings` | Notification-related settings |
| `/management/billing/settings` | Billing-related runtime settings |

Django Admin is still available for low-level inspection and legacy operations, but it is no longer the only day-to-day configuration path.

## ⭐ Recommended LLM Providers

Devify is not tied to a single LLM vendor. The management console ships with **17+ built-in providers** — OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, DashScope (Qwen), Mistral, xAI, MiniMax, Moonshot, ZAI, Volcengine, Meta Llama, Amazon Nova, NVIDIA NIM, OpenRouter, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

This allows you to bind different models for different jobs, such as:

- one multimodal model for image understanding and intent detection
- one text model for summarization and metadata extraction
- one dedicated model for smart delivery channels

If you don't know where to start, the providers below have been validated with Devify workflows. Any of them can be configured in minutes via `/management/llm/config` using the OpenAI-compatible provider type or the dedicated built-in provider.

It is a convenient choice for Devify self-hosting: one account covers both the multimodal model for image understanding and the text model for summarization, without juggling multiple vendor accounts. Configure it in Devify as an <code>OpenAI-compatible</code> provider with <code>api_base</code> pointing to <a href="https://agione.pro">agione.pro</a>.

| <img src="docs/images/llm-providers/openrouter.png" width="16"> [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) | Trying many models behind one endpoint | ✅ | Built-in `OpenRouter` provider |

> 💡 Devify requires at least one **multimodal** model for image understanding and intent detection. A common minimal setup is a single aggregator account (e.g. AGIone or OpenRouter) bound to all Threadline jobs.

The Quick Start below is a condensed summary; see the guides above for full detail.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development

```bash
cp env.sample .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

> For the full, verified development setup (dev uses `.env.dev`, requires
> `--env-file .env.dev`, MySQL variables, and a host-side `npm install`), follow
> the [Development guide](https://aimychats.com/en/self-hosting/deployment/development.html).

Default local access:

- API and Django Admin: `http://localhost:8000`
- Flower: `http://localhost:5555`

### Production

```bash
cp env.sample .env
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The production compose file includes the full application stack: API, worker,
scheduler, UI, MySQL, Redis, Nginx, and Haraka.

### One-command Installation

For a production-style self-hosted installation, `install.sh` downloads the
release files directly, generates the initial configuration and secrets, pulls
the Docker images, starts the complete stack, and verifies `/health`. It does
not clone the Git repository.

Requirements:

- Docker with Compose (Docker Desktop is supported on macOS and Windows)
- Linux: Ubuntu, Debian, Rocky, Alma, or CentOS; Windows: Git Bash
- `amd64` CPU architecture (published images are amd64 only for now)
- At least 2 GB available memory and 5 GB free disk space (4 GB RAM and 20 GB
  disk are recommended)

Run the installer on Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneprolabs/devify/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

On Windows, run the equivalent command from Git Bash; Docker Desktop must be
installed and running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneprolabs/devify/main/install.sh | bash
```

For networks with limited GitHub access, use the China distribution channel:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/oneprolabs/devify/raw/main/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- \
  --channel cn --download-source gitee
```

Both GitHub and Gitee use `oneprolabs/devify` as the source repository.

The installer automatically selects an available download source and the
Aliyun ACR image registry. To install Docker automatically on supported Linux
distributions, add `--install-docker`. Use `--yes` for a non-interactive run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneprolabs/devify/main/install.sh | \
  sudo bash -s -- --channel cn --yes
```

Common options include `--dir /srv/devify`, `--port 8080`,
`--admin-port 19443`, `--smtp-port 25`, `--domain dev.example.com`, and
`--version 1.2.3`. Run `install.sh --help` for the complete list.

After installation:

- Main site: `http://<host>:8080`
- Admin panel: `https://<host>:19443/admin` (self-signed certificate)
- Configuration: `<install-dir>/.env`
- Installation details and the initial admin password:
  `<install-dir>/install-info.env`

The default installation directory is `/opt/devify` on Linux/macOS and
`$HOME/devify` on Windows Git Bash. Re-running the installer is safe: existing
`.env` configuration and application data are preserved. Outbound email uses
the console backend by default; configure SMTP in `.env` before relying on
email notifications.

### Haraka Inbound Email

Devify includes Haraka for auto-assigned inbound email addresses. When enabled,
users can receive mail at addresses such as:

```text
{username}@{AUTO_ASSIGN_EMAIL_DOMAIN}
```

Haraka receives SMTP traffic on port 25, stores raw email files under
`data/haraka/emails`, and the worker/scheduler processes those files into the
normal email workflow.

For production, the mail domain must be configured in three places:

- `.env`: `AUTO_ASSIGN_EMAIL_DOMAIN=example.com`
- `docker/haraka/config/host_list.prod`: add `example.com`
- DNS: add an MX record for `example.com` pointing to the host that runs Haraka

Recommended DNS records:

```text
example.com.        MX   10 mail.example.com.
mail.example.com.   A    <server-public-ip>
example.com.        TXT  "v=spf1 mx -all"
_dmarc.example.com. TXT  "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@example.com"
```

Port 25 must be open from the public internet. If STARTTLS is required, create
Haraka certificates with:

```bash
HARAKA_DOMAIN=mail.example.com HARAKA_CERT_EMAIL=admin@example.com \
  ./scripts/manage-haraka-certs.sh apply
```

More details are documented in `docker/haraka/README.md`.

## ⚙️ Required Configuration

Before first run, review at least these settings in `.env`:

### Basic Runtime

- `USE_MIRROR`
- `SITE_DOMAIN`
- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- `AUTO_ASSIGN_EMAIL_DOMAIN`

### Email / Notifications

- `EMAIL_HOST`
- `EMAIL_PORT`
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`

### Optional OAuth

- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`

### AI Models and Providers

AI services are now configured primarily through the management console, not through a single fixed set of `.env` variables.

Recommended path after startup:

1. Open `/management/llm/config`
2. Add one or more `LLMConfig` entries
3. Configure provider-specific fields such as:
   - `api_key`
   - `api_base`
   - `model`
   - `deployment` for Azure OpenAI
   - optional parameters such as `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, and request timeout
4. Bind the appropriate models in `/management/app-settings` and `/management/threadline/config`

In other words, `.env` is mainly for base runtime setup, while actual model provider configuration is managed in the application.

## 📦 Self-Hosting Requirements

Minimum recommendation:

- 2 CPU cores
- 4GB RAM
- 20GB storage
- Docker and Docker Compose

External services:

- at least one supported LLM provider account and API credentials
- multimodal model capability for image understanding and intent detection
- SMTP server for notifications

For HTTPS, use a reverse proxy such as Nginx Proxy Manager, Traefik, or Caddy.
