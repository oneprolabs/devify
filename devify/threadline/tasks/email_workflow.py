Email Workflow Tasks

This module provides Celery task wrappers for the LangGraph-based
email processing workflow. It replaces the chain-based approach with
a unified state graph execution.

Workflow Architecture:
- Single workflow execution (no Celery chains)
- Unified state management via LangGraph
- Atomic database operations in prepare/finalize nodes
- Built-in checkpointing and error recovery

    Execute LangGraph-based email processing workflow.

    This task replaces the traditional Celery chain approach with a
    unified LangGraph StateGraph execution. The workflow manages all
    processing steps (multimodal image understanding, LLM, Summary,
    Issue) in a single graph.

    Workflow Steps (executed by LangGraph):
    1. WorkflowPrepareNode - Load and validate email data
    2. ImageIntentNode - Process image attachments with multimodal LLM
    3. LLMEmailNode - Process email content with LLM
    4. SummaryNode - Generate email summary
    5. IssueNode - Validate and prepare issue creation
    6. WorkflowFinalizeNode - Sync all results to database

    State Machine Integration:
    - Prepare: Sets status to PROCESSING (unless force mode)
    - Finalize: Sets status to SUCCESS or FAILED based on workflow result
    - Force mode: Skips all status changes

    Args:
        email_id (str): ID of the email to process
        force (bool): Whether to force processing regardless of current
                     status. When True, bypasses status checks and allows
                     reprocessing even if content already exists.
        language (str, optional): Language override for this processing
                                 (e.g., 'zh-CN', 'en-US'). If provided,
                                 will override user's default language
                                 for this retry only.
        scene (str, optional): Scene override for this processing
                              (e.g., 'chat', 'product_issue'). If provided,
                              will override user's default scene for this
                              retry only.

    Returns:
        str: The email_id (for Celery chain compatibility)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If email not found
